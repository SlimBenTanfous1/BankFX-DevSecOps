# BankFX â€“ JavaFX Banking App with DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline

**BankFX** is a simulated desktop banking application built with **JavaFX** that showcases **modern DevSecOps practices**. It includes user authentication, user management (CRUD), and real-time financial data like **stock market trends** and **currency exchange rates** using public APIs.

## Features

- **Login & Sign-Up Interface** with validation
- **User CRUD Management** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **Real-Time Stock & Currency Data** from public APIs
- **Responsive JavaFX GUI**
- **Password Hashing** for secure credentials
- **Containerized with Docker**
- **CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions**
- **Security Scanning Tools Integrated**:
  - Static code analysis (SpotBugs)
  - Dependency scanning (OWASP Dependency-Check)
  - Secrets detection (Gitleaks)

## Project Architecture

[ JavaFX GUI ] --> [ App Logic (Java) ] --> [ SQLite DB or JSON ] --> [ Public API Calls (Stock/Currency) ]


## DevSecOps Pipeline

- **CI/CD** with GitHub Actions:
  - Build and test the app
  - Run security scans (SAST, dependency checks)
  - Package as Docker image

- **Security Checks**:
  - OWASP Dependency-Check: identifies known vulnerable libraries
  - Gitleaks: detects hardcoded secrets
  - SpotBugs: scans for Java code vulnerabilities

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: JavaFX (FXML, CSS)
- **Backend**: Java
- **Database**: SQLite or JSON (optional)
- **APIs**: ExchangeRate-API, Yahoo Finance, etc.
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions
- **Security**: Gitleaks, SpotBugs, OWASP Dependency-Check
